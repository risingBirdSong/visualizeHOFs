## first basic step -> working with number arrays

### create a basic function that we'll use to transform our input number array

### animate the process of the transform function being applied to each number individually

# design / layout

### consider using react router to make the links take the user to different components.

### align numbers with array brackets vertically

### add a list of further reading to already high quality explanations of how HOF works and the advantages. no need to reinvent the wheel here.
